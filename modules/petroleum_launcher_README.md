## Getting Started

### 1. Program Detection
When the module first loads, it automatically scans for installed petroleum software:

1. Click **"Refresh Programs"** to rescan for software
2. View detected programs in the **Programs** tab
3. Check status: ‚úÖ Installed or ‚ùå Not Found
4. View version information and executable paths

### 2. Launching Programs
- **Double-click** any detected program to launch it
- Select a program and click **"Launch Selected"**
- Monitor launch status in the status bar

### 3. Creating Workflows
1. Click **"New Workflow"** in the Workflows tab
2. Configure workflow information:
   - **Name**: Descriptive workflow title
   - **Description**: What the workflow does
   - **Author**: Your name/organization
3. Add automation steps:
   - **Launch Program**: Start a petroleum application
   - **Open File**: Open project files with default applications
   - **Wait**: Add delays between steps
   - **Run Command**: Execute system commands
4. Configure window positioning for each step
5. Save the workflow

### 4. Running Workflows
- Select a workflow from the list
- Click **"Run Workflow"** to execute
- Monitor progress in the progress panel
- Use **"Stop Automation"** to cancel execution

## Supported Software

The module automatically detects the following petroleum industry software:

### Schlumberger Software
- **Petrel Platform** - E&P software platform

- **OLGA** - Multiphase flow simulator
- **Techlog** - Wellbore software platform
- **Eclipse Reservoir Simulator** - Reservoir simulation

### Adding New Software
To add support for additional petroleum software:

1. Edit the `PETROLEUM_PROGRAM_CONFIG` dictionary in the module
2. Add detection rules similar to existing programs:
```python
"new_program": {
    "display_name": "New Software Name",
    "check_method": {
        "type": "registry",
        "keys": [
            {"path": r"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall",
             "match_value": "DisplayName",
             "match_pattern": r"New Software.*",
             "get_value": "DisplayVersion"}
        ]
    }
}
```

## Workflow Automation

### Step Types

#### 1. Launch Program
- **Purpose**: Start a petroleum application
- **Configuration**:
  - Select from detected programs
  - Set window position (optional)
  - Add command-line parameters

#### 2. Open File
- **Purpose**: Open project or data files
- **Configuration**:
  - File path selection with browser
  - Automatic file association

#### 3. Wait
- **Purpose**: Add delays between automation steps
- **Configuration**:
  - Duration in seconds (1-3600)
  - Useful for program loading times

#### 4. Run Command
- **Purpose**: Execute system commands or scripts
- **Configuration**:
  - Command string
  - Timeout settings
  - Working directory

### Window Positioning
Each step can configure window positioning:
- **Left/Top**: Screen coordinates
- **Width/Height**: Window dimensions
- **Use Position**: Enable/disable positioning

### Example Workflow
```yaml

```python
# In workflow "Run Command" step:
python "C:\Scripts\data_processor.py" --input "project.dat" --output "results.json"
```

### Integration with Other Tools
- Export workflow data as JSON for external processing
- Use command-line tools within workflow steps
- Integrate with version control for workflow management

### Batch Operations
Create workflows for:
- **Project Setup**: Launch multiple programs with specific files
